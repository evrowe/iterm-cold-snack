# Cold Snack for iTerm

A crisp, refreshing, original color theme for iTerm 2.

There's nothing better in life than a tall, refreshing, cold snack for your tastebuds and your eyeballs. Reminiscent of the Unofficial Official Beer of Montana, the Cold Snack theme will soothe and satiate your mind
as you nimbly execute your bidding upon your system.
